# Fake Restaurants

Fake Restaurants is a playful restaurant review platform developed as an exam project for the Web Technologies course at the University of Naples "Federico II" during my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## Purpose

This project is a fictional restaurant review platform where users can create imaginary restaurants and write reviews for them. The goal is purely entertainment-driven, engaging users in the creative process of crafting fake content for fun.

## Development Guidelines

The primary focus during the development of this project was simplicity. Instead of relying on large, complex frameworks that handle tasks automatically, I opted for minimal dependencies that are easy to understand and manage. My goal was to maintain full control over the technologies used, avoiding unnecessary tools or abstractions. For this reason, I chose not to use transpilers (e.g., TypeScript, Vite, Babel) or full-stack frameworks (e.g., Next.js, SvelteKit). Instead, I selected **Koa** for the backend and **Preact** for the frontend. These tools provide only the essential features, allowing for a lightweight setup and a deeper understanding of the application's functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Koa – A minimalist Node.js framework for building lightweight and flexible server-side applications.
- **Frontend**: Preact – A fast, lightweight alternative to React with a small footprint.
- **Code Quality**:
  - **ESLint** – A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code. While complex to configure, ESLint provides visible improvements in code consistency and helps maintain high-quality, error-free code, enhancing my control over the codebase.
  - **Prettier** – An opinionated code formatter that enforces consistent style across the project. Though it introduces additional development dependencies, Prettier's clear, automated formatting reduces manual effort and improves readability, aligning with my goal of maintaining control over the code.
- **No Transpilers**: Handwritten JavaScript for maximum control and clarity.
